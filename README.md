# Connect4 Agent

Connect 4 "Alpha Zero" agent implemented with MCTS and CNNs.

## Structure

We have the follwing three components for our project that build on each other:

- Monte Carlo Tree Search
- Initial AlphaZero implementation
- Refined AlphaZero implementation using a general framework

The files for each of these are contained in their own sub-directories along with a README.md with information about how to run various commands. The Python dependencies are defined in the requirements.txt file provided at project root.

## Installation

Open a terminal and navigate to project root directory (where this file is located). Then run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to download all dependencies. Note: this operation may take sometime to finish as `torch` is a large package with its own dependencies.
