# connect4-agent

Connect 4 agent implemented with MCTS and (potentially) neural nets.

# alphazero

An attempt to explore using a deep neural network to predict the next best move from any given state, using mcts to build training data.

# Protocol

### Conversations (post anything here)

Luke - The Alphazero implementation below would be cool to (at least try) to implement, using this codebase as a starting point.

Liam - I'm working on the alphazero implementation, using the above youtube playlist as a starting point. I haven't got training to work yet, but it does run and just gets stuck in an infinite loop.
